Lets add a dropdown to let the user select the model metrics, this involves a few steps:
1) Add a `ui.input_select` item to the card with two options
2) Modify the `@render.plotly` to conditionally display one plot or the other based on that dropdown

You will only need one `@render.plotly` function.
