## Goals

- Learn some Shiny best practices
- Get a sense of how large complicated apps are structured
- Know when you need to refactor your application

## Avoid premature optimization

- Start by just getting your app to work
- Take small steps to avoid repetition
- Ultimately you're the one who needs to work with the code

## When should you optimize?
- You're trying to hold too much in your head
- Changing the app is difficult
- Other people don't understand your code
- You don't understand your code!

## Three main techniques
- Use functions to generate UI
- Separate reactive and non-reactive code
- Modules

## We're only going to cover two

- Use functions to generate UI

# UI Functions

## Background on functions
- Functions are the best way to improve code quality
    - Define logic in one place
    - Convenient place to document code
    - Handle errors 
    - Tests and typing
    - Easy to use with iterators

## Data Science blind spot

For some reason data scientists forget all about funcitons when writing Shiny UIs.

## UIs are just objects

- Recall that Shiny UIs are just objects
    - They can be stored in variables
    - They can be composed 
    - They can be generated by functions

## Using functions

```{.python}
from shiny import App, render, ui

app_ui = ui.page_fluid(
    ui.input_slider("n1", "N", 0, 100, 20),
    ui.input_slider("n2", "N", 0, 100, 20),
    ui.input_slider("n3", "N", 0, 100, 20),
    ui.input_slider("n4", "N", 0, 100, 20),
    ui.input_slider("n5", "N", 0, 100, 20),
    ui.input_slider("n6", "N", 0, 100, 20),
)

app = App(app_ui, None)
```

## Using functions

```{.python}
from shiny import App, render, ui

def my_slider(id, label):
    return ui.input_slider(id, label, 0, 100, 20)

app_ui = ui.page_fluid(
    my_slider("n1", "First number"),
    my_slider("n2", "Second number"),
    my_slider("n3", "Third number"),
    my_slider("n4", "Fourth number"),
    my_slider("n5", "Fifth number"),
)

app = App(app_ui, None)
```

## Iterating functions

```{.python}
from shiny import App, render, ui

def my_slider(id, label):
    return ui.input_slider(id, label + "Number", 0, 100, 20)

numbers = ["n1", "n2", "n3", "n4", "n5", "n6"]
labels = ["First", "Second", "Third", "Fourth", "Fifth", "Sixth"]

app_ui = ui.page_fluid([my_slider(x, y) for x, y in zip(numbers, labels)])

app = App(app_ui, None)
```

## Benefits of functions
- Defines the the logic in one place
- First step on the abstraction ladder
- Clarifies how components interact with eachother


## Your turn

Go to [exercises/13-ui-functions](../exercises/13-ui-functions.html) or run problems `5.1` and `5.2` in `apps/problem-sets/exercises/5-workflows`.

## Separate Reactive and Non-reactive logic

- Most Shiny app code is non-reactive
    - Drawing plots
    - Summarizing data
    - Interacting with databases
- It's fine to include this code inside reactive functions
- As your appp improves you should separate them

## Reactivity makes everything harder
- Reactive context makes them inherently more difficult
    - Harder to debug
    - Harder to test
    - Harder to document
    - Harder to reason about

## The rule
**Pull as much logic as possible out of the reactive context**

## Why?
- Non-reactive functions are familliar and predictable
- You can call them in a notebook
- You can write unit tests 
- Makes your reactive code much clearer
- You can reuse them in other contextx

## Classes are also great
- Useful when data and methods are closely coupled
- Makes data validation easy

## Your turn

Go to [exercises/14-extract-functions](../exercises/13-extract-functions.html) or run problems `5.3` and `5.4` in `apps/problem-sets/exercises/5-workflows`.


## Modules
- Not going to teach them, but you should know about them
- Used when you have a bit of UI code which goes with a bit of server code
- Effectively creates a mini Shiny app
- Allows you to package and re-use parts of your application
- Great for working with teams on larger apps
